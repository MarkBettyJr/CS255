  Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a project in which I worked for a system developer contracted by DriverPass do develop a cloud based app that would allow users to study, and practice for the driving test. They could schedule, see progress, purchase plans, and test online.

  What did you do particularly well?
I really did well translating the client interview into a real system. I really liked the idea of listening to the client and surpassing their expations.

  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would have took more time on the UML diagrams. I think I could have been more detailed. Better documentation could help the client better understand what they are getting.

  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I really listened to what the client wanted, and how they anticipated the end users using the application. Everything from the client's need to not maintain servers to other more specific ideas about how the admin's would be able to schedule for the end users.

  How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think I approach designing software analytically. I would use standard SDLC practices and tools to provide a system that is well documentated, meets the clients goals, and is able to be maintained.
